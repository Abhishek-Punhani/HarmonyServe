Harmony Serve is all about helping people and making our community better. We rescue extra food from college cafeterias and give it to those who need it. Crafts Haven is where talented artisans showcase their handmade creations, helping them earn a living while preserving traditional crafts. And through our ShikshaSaathi program, college students help kids who need extra support with their schoolwork, making sure everyone gets a fair chance to learn and succeed. Together, we're building a kinder, more caring world for everyone. \n
